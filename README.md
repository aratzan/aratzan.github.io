1. In this assignment I did a good job of using various HTML and CSS elements to style out my website. This included CSS rules for headers, hyperlinking to other pages, and organizing HTML files. Both my HTML and CSS files had no errors as validated by w3. I also succesfully gave permissions to my index.html file and got my cs.tufts.edu page to link to my github.io and the other parts of my website. In this project I could have done a better job of commiting more frequently with git. I'm sure my git skills and commenting will improve as I continue to useit.  

2. I collaborated with TA Robert Yang in order to setup my git repo properly on my laptop and to properly execute the index.html permissions. 

3. I would say this project took approximately 4.5 hours.
