	<h1> The story of Alexander Ratzan </h1>

	<p> Hi! My name is Alexander Ratzan and here is a short biography about myself: I was born on July 20th 1999 in Washington D.C. When I was the spry young age of one and a half my family moved to Belgium, my mother's home country. I spent about eight years in Belgium speaking mostly English and Flemish and a little bit of French. My family includes me, my mom, my dad, my brother, and my dog, Ginger. When I was in fourth grade I moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where I would live before attending Tufts University. I went to Princeton High School and had a good time with my friends and playing sports. My passion is soccer and I play on the team here at Tufts University. As of now I am a sophomore (Class of 2021) majoring in Cognitive and Brain Sciences with a pre-med concentration. I hope you learned a little bit about me from this biography and had an easy time navigating my website. </p>
